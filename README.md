# Welcome to my GitHub Profile.

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm diablolurker, just a casual IT Guy and explorer of the digital realms. Here you'll find a mix of my experiments, projects, and possibly some random musings. Feel free to take a look around and vibe with me! 

## About Me

I'm someone who's constantly curious about technology and its applications. From securing to tinkering with various software and hardware, I love to dive into new things and see where they take me.

## Current Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:

- **WebImage**: *Just a container pack that verifies if the webserver (nginx) is working well*
- **Weird Discord Bots**: *IYKYKWIM*

Feel free to check them out and leave any feedback or suggestions
